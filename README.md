Integrate [Mermaid Diagrams](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) in SAP GUI Containers

Source Code of mermaid release 11.12.0 is included as SMW0 Object (downloaded from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js`)

## Disclaimer
This is a work in progress, there are bugs. The background color of the HTML container is determined with cl_gui_resources, but this might not work correctly if corrections described in [SAP Note 3002961](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3002961) are not applied in the System. 
The font color and type are on the todo list (doesn't work yet).

## Prerequisites
Mermaid does not work in the Internet Explorer Browser Control, so the Edge Chromium Control has to be used. More info in [SAP Note 2913405](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2913405)

And SAP GUI version should be from 7.70 or higher.
